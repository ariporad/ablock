## Why?

I wanted to have a Github status for commit message validation. So here it is.

## What's with the name?

Well, I couldn't figure out a good one. I figured that this is kind of like your English teacher nagging at you about
how your sentence is completely messed up. (Except that when they nag you it's in gibberish). I... well, let's say 
I'm not the world's biggest fan of English class (no matter what you say, vocab is cruel and unusual punishment), so 
I didn't want to name it after that. But I have English class for A Block (at my school, we have blocks instead of 
periods, and letters instead of numbers), so I called it that. (And no, it most certainly wasn't because the domain 
was available.)
